CFTester: test tool for codeforces
========

If you use this tool, you can compare an output of
your codeforces code to another output which
generated by other user's code.

Usage is very simple. You prepare two codes and
write test script which contain a function
to generate input data.

And you write just one line:

CFTester.run_test(input_func)

where input_func is the function described above.

Then you run the script with two arguments,
which is a command to execute the two codes.
For Example:

$ mytester.py 'python mycode.py' 'python othercode.py'
