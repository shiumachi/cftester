CFTester: test tool for codeforces
========

If you use this tool, you can compare an output of
your codeforces code to another output which
generated by other user's code.

Usage is very simple. You prepare two codes and
write test script which contain a function
to generate input data.

And you write just one line:

CFTester.run_test(input_func)

where input_func is the function described above.

Then you run the script with two arguments,
which is a command to execute the two codes.
For Example:

$ mytester.py 'python mycode.py' 'python othercode.py'

If you run the command, you may get some output
which two script return different answer against 
specific inputs.

EXAMPLE
=======

You can run sample script 'example.py' as follows:

$ python example.py ./test1.py ./test2.py

Both two scripts will return some float value
(like distance of vector) against three int value, 
but test2.py always return 0 if the first value 
of input is -1.

Here is the output of the command:

Case#|input|output1|output2
---------------------------
1|-1 -1 -1|1.73205080757|0
2|-1 -1 0|1.41421356237|0
3|-1 0 -1|1.41421356237|0
4|-1 0 0|1.0|0

There are four column in the output.
Case# is a case number.
input is an input data.
output1/2 is outputs of two script you specified,
these outputs may be different value.
